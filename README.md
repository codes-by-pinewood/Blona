# Coding Challenge  
This challenge is on purpose quite open-ended, just as working in an early-stage start-up is 🚀 \
The Challenge 🧗🏽‍♀️ \
The challenge consists of 3 sub-tasks that should be completed in order to reach the final product.
## Task 1: User-Login Page
Users should only be able to log in with the following credentials:
Username: Blona
Password: ToTheSky

## Task 2: PDF Uploader
You are tasked with building a (very basic) website where (a logged-in) user can: 
1. Upload new PDFs 
2. See the PDFs they have previously uploaded 
3. Delete previously uploaded PDFs 

## Task 3: Text Parser
For each uploaded PDF the content (i.e. text) should be parsed out of the PDF 
Parsing should be triggered once a new PDF is uploaded \
The plain text belonging to each PDF should be made available to the user (e.g. on a button click next to each PDF, via toggling, etc. - you can be creative!) \
Note: You do not need to worry about formatting the parsed text :) 
### Tech Stack 💻
We are using Typescript, React, Next.js, and Node.js and would love to see you using this stack in action during the challenge! Feel free to use any React Library like Chakra UI or Material UI. Feel free to use Vercel (or any other front-end hosting service - trust me it makes your life 10x easier!). Other decisions (database, hosting, etc.) are your choice - we are excited to discuss your decisions together! \
### Things to Consider 💡
Working in a team is different than working on your own project. So please be careful about documenting your code and making it easily accessible to others to read and understand
Unit tests give plus points \
Do not spend more than a couple of hours on this please :)
