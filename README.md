# Coding Challenge Blona 
This challenge is on purpose quite open-ended, just as working in an early-stage start-up is 🚀 
The Challenge 🧗🏽‍♀️
The challenge consists of 3 sub-tasks that should be completed in order to reach the final product.
## Task 1: User-Login Page
Users should only be able to log in with the following credentials:
Username: Blona
Password: ToTheSky

## Task 2: PDF Uploader
You are tasked with building a (very basic) website where (a logged-in) user can: 
Upload new PDFs
See the PDFs they have previously uploaded 
Delete previously uploaded PDFs 

## Task 3: Text Parser
For each uploaded PDF the content (i.e. text) should be parsed out of the PDF 
Parsing should be triggered once a new PDF is uploaded 
The plain text belonging to each PDF should be made available to the user (e.g. on a button click next to each PDF, via toggling, etc. - you can be creative!) 
Note: You do not need to worry about formatting the parsed text :)
Tech Stack 💻
We are using Typescript, React, Next.js, and Node.js and would love to see you using this stack in action during the challenge! Feel free to use any React Library like Chakra UI or Material UI. Feel free to use Vercel (or any other front-end hosting service - trust me it makes your life 10x easier!). Other decisions (database, hosting, etc.) are your choice - we are excited to discuss your decisions together!
Things to Consider 💡
Working in a team is different than working on your own project. So please be careful about documenting your code and making it easily accessible to others to read and understand
Unit tests give plus points 
Do not spend more than a couple of hours on this please :)
Deliverable  📩
Please send the following to charlotte@blona.de: 
Link to running website of the project

Next Steps 🔜
We will review your final product & code based on the following criteria: Functioning of the final product, how clear the code is, how well the project & code are documented, the general appearance of the product 
We will schedule a call where you can walk us through your product, we can discuss it and ask questions



If you have any questions feel free to reach out to Charlotte at charlotte@blona.de.
